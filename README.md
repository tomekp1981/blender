# Camera retime

There are two cameras in the scene. One is raw camera I got from tracking software, the other is duplicated with animation remover. It has drivers on location and rotation. Every driver uses TimeWarpCurveOnLocX as input. Then all drivers animation is copy/pasted from original camera. This rig allows for controlling camera timing using a channel, but is a bit tedious to setup.
